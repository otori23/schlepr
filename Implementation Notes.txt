- put controllers & services in a different module; load when main module
- jumbotron is not in the header it is in content
- jumbotron look some thing like confusion's jumbotron but use the hand/box logo

<header> -> look @ twitter's header
<content> -> cards (cards show summary; clicking on cards show modal with more details; can add comments)
<footer>

1) Users

- how to login in user on succesful registration; is this done from client side ? See instructor's code
- how to logout when using jwt; is this done by front-end client ? See instructor's code
- add a schlepr user; and maybe redesign the way the verify middlewares are used
- still look to explore passport built-in in method for verify or protecting routes
- test the User's getName method; is User.methods === User.prototype ???

2) MongoDB

- the schlepr database shows up in the database server after your application has inserted at least one document into one collection

3) $resource

// returns a resource class object
$resource('/api/entries/:id');

// Entry in a resource class object (injected into controller)
// note: return value of .get() is assigned to a var; so no need to get the return value in the .get() callback 
// var entry: think of as instance of Entry class; a representation of server side Mongo document
var entry = Entry.get({ id: $scope.id }, function() {
  console.log(entry);
});

// create an intanse of the Entry class
// document is empty at this point
$scope.entry = new Entry();

// two ways of getting a return value from call to $resource methods

// no arg passsed into the callback
var entry = Entry.get({ id: $scope.id }, function() {
  console.log(entry);
});

// from callback
// no arg passsed into the callback
Entry.get({ id: $scope.id }, function(data) {
  $scope.entry = data;
});

4) Header

- try again to add "remember me" checkbox
- login and registration form validation; something basic; re-enter password ?
- change on successfull login; with ability to logout (ng-if vs ng-show ?)
- on bad login where is the 401 message being printed to console ? from ui-bootstrap modal ? see docs, maybe option to stop logs ?
- confirm that registering new users will work
- what is going on with $state ? angular-ui or angular core ?
- commit to git

5) $log

app.config(function($logProvider) {
  $logProvider.debugEnabled(true);
});

6) Logo

disable all logs at once, rather than delete them line by line manually.
