1) Users

- how to login in user on succesful registration; is this done from client side ? See instructor's code
- how to logout when using jwt; is this done by front-end client ? See instructor's code
- add a schlepr user; and maybe redesign the way the verify middlewares are used
- still look to explore passport built-in in method for verify or protecting routes
- test the User's getName method; is User.methods === User.prototype ???

2) MongoDB

- the schlepr database shows up in the database server after your application has inserted at least one document into one collection
